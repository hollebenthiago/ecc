            <h1>Elliptic Curve group law (multiplication)</h1>
        </div>
        <div class='intro'>
            <p>Simple implementation of scalar multiplication on elliptic curves over prime fields of positive characteristic. The prime needs to be different from 2 and 3.</p>
            <p>The elliptic curve is assumed to be of the form y² = x³ + ax + b</p>
            <p>The points are assumed to be in projective coordinates (z = 1 unless z = x = 0 and y = 1).</p>
