            <ul>
                <li>
                    Simple implementation of addition on elliptic curves over prime fields of positive characteristic. The prime needs to be different from 2 and 3.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The elliptic curve is assumed to be of the form y² = x³ + ax + b
                </li>
                <li>
                    The points are assumed to be in projective coordinates (z = 1 unless z = x = 0 and y = 1).
                </li>
