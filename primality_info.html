            <h1>Elliptic Curve factorization Method</h1>
        </div>
        <div class='intro'>
            <p>Samples n random elliptic curves (in short weierstrass form) and check if it is possible to calculate 100P where P is a random point on the elliptic curve sampled.</p>
            <p>If factors are not found, it does not mean the number is prime. It may find more than one prime factor (the factor found need not be prime).</p>
