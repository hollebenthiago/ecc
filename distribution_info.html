        <div class='intro'>
            <p>Given a prime p, it is known that the possible cardinalities of rational points on an elliptic curve lie in a closed interval.</p>
            <p>We can then count the number of elliptic curves with a given number of rational points (always over the prime field given by p).</p>
            <p>The prime p is not tested to be prime (check for a non-prime p and see what happens).</p>
