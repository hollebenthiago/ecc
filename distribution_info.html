            <h1>Elliptic Curve Distribution</h1>
        </div>
        <div class='intro'>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p class = 'pinfo'>
                        Given a prime p, it is known that the possible cardinalities of rational points on an elliptic curve lie in a closed interval.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p class = 'pinfo'>
                        We can then count the number of elliptic curves with a given number of rational points (always over the prime field given by p).
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p class = 'pinfo'>
                        The prime p is not tested to be prime (check for a non-prime p and see what happens).
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
